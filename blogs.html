      <h3>Toddler Travel:4 Helpful Tips when Traveling with your Toddler.</h3>
      <h4>Traveling with your Toddler</h4>
      <p>
        Terrified to travel with your toddler on your next voyage? Well, for me
        the airport was probably the most stressful part of traveling. Adding a
        toddler into the equation, double the stress. While most people think
        taking a carry-on and a charged phone is all you need. Us parents need
        to triple the supplies for traveling with toddlers.

        We have flown 3 times with our daughter and drove an 8 hour car ride to
        Disney World. I am not an expert at traveling with toddlers, but we have
        been more successful than we thought.
